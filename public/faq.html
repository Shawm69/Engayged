            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Engayged is a hyper-ironic Proof-of-Attention protocol designed to direct maximum eyeballs toward the Sonic ecosystem. Instead of farming yield, you farm clout. It’s built on memes, powered by engagement, and ruled by the terminally online. The more attention you generate, the more $GAY you earn.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-header">💸 How do I earn $GAY?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Connect your wallet and your Twitter.</p>
            <p>Tweet about Sonic, its tokens, and ecosystem projects.</p>
            <p>Score points for attention.</p>
            <p>At the end of each weekly epoch (Wednesday @ 11:59 PM UTC), your points are converted into $GAY.</p>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">🚀 What can I do with $GAY?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <ul>
                <li>Claim it and sell it.</li>
                <li>Stake it (or LP and Stake it) to earn veGAY, which gives you governance power.</li>
                <li>Vote on which protocols should earn more attention.</li>
                <li>Get bribed by desperate tokens who want your mindshare.</li>
                <li>Clown on everyone else who’s not as engaged as you.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">🧠 What is veGAY?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>veGAY (Very GAY) is a soulbound governance token you earn by locking $GAY or $GAY LP tokens. It lets you vote on where the Engayged community directs its attention each epoch. The more veGAY you have, the more influence you hold. It's like veCRV, but gayer and funnier.</p>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">🎯 What are the multipliers?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Each epoch, protocols with more veGAY votes get a higher “Mindshare Multiplier.” This means tweets about those projects earn more points for users. Everyone can earn, but your veGAY determines who gets the most attention boost. Votes are proportional — every project gets a piece based on their share.</p>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">💰 What are bribes?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Bribes are rewards offered by protocols to veGAY voters. Projects can incentivize votes by offering tokens, NFTs, or other perks. If you vote for a bribed project, you can claim those rewards on the Rewards tab. It’s like vote-buying, but socially accepted and extremely gay.</p>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">✨ What are Golden Engaygements?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Once per epoch, a random user gets Golden Engayged — a status that doubles their points that week and gives you a shimmering visual effect. It’s completely RNG. It’s unfair. It’s awesome. It’s Web3.</p>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How does the referral system work?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>You get a referral link after connecting your account. Anyone who joins using it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gets a “You’ve Been Shilled” badge (+1% bonus points)</li>
                <li>Gives you 5% of their points each week.</li>
                <li>Counts toward your referral milestones and badge tier</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Referrers unlock perks at 5, 20, 50, and 100 invites. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="faq-section">
            <h2 class="faq-header">📜 Is $GAY a security?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Absolutely not. $GAY is a memecoin. It is a Proof-of-Attention reward with zero financial guarantees, zero roadmap, and zero use outside of making you look cool on the internet. This is not a product. This is a performance.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-header">🐸 Why is it called Engayged?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Because “Sonic Chain Social Engagement Reward Distribution Protocol” didn’t slap hard enough.</p>
